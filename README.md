# TicTacToe
This is a simple TicTacToe game with bots

Please keep in mind that this is my first python project, so it might not be very clean. Might contain errors.
Moreover, it might seem very java-ish, since I started on that language. 
One more note, because this is my first Python project, this application will have a very simple interface.
However, the game is alright, it should be usable at least. Some bots are somewhat difficult to beat.
One other note is that it is not a finished project yet, since I couldn't actually finish the impossible bot. 
I attempted to implement a mini-max algorithm, but I did not succeed in this unfortunately.

TODO: some stats on how good bots are.

Feel free to inspire your code on it. However, I would appreciate it if you would reference my parts somewhere.
